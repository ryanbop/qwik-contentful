          <p>
            When I got this role I shifted from half queue work, half product management/development into a full time internal Subject Matter Expert (SME) role.
            I'm now an SME for a bespoke DoE application ðŸ˜….

          <p>
            "School land" got boring, so I moved up and into a Corporate role with the Department of Education. 
            In this role I was effectivly one of the Queue monkeys for the Identity and Access Management team, looking after around 700,000 identities.
            This role taught me alot about how the government "works", and all the policy/tape that is in the way of doing work.
            Here I learnt about various Identity Products.
            Towards the end of this role I had moved away from queue monkey and onto product development and testing.

          <p>
            This is where I got my "Start" in IT. I was employed as "Tech Support", but as usual with government it flourished into so much more... 
            By the end I was a: Camera Man, Producer, Gardener and Caterrer.
            Oh yeah and ontop of all of that I did IT.
